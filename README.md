### Key Features
- ðŸš€ **Advanced Computational Network**: Incentivizing miners to enhance computational resources for complex AI/ML tasks.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Performance Commitment**: Miners commit to a category and volume per epoch.
- ðŸ’° **Incentive Mechanism**: 
  - `reward = (0.6 * accuracy_score) + (0.4 * reasoning_score) - 0.1 * time_penalty`
  - `accuracy_score` is based on the correctness of the result.
  - `reasoning_score` measures the similarity between the generated text and reference data.
  - `time_score` is derived from the time taken to generate the result.
- ðŸŒŸ **Continuous Improvement**: Adding more math problem set and category.
